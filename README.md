# Startup Success Prediction and Robust Portfolio Allocation
Analyzed 7,500 startups from Crunchbase to predict startup success and optimize portfolio allocation for venture investments. Success was defined as Series B startups that, within five years, either IPO’d, were acquired, or secured a Series C funding round. Used an optimal classification tree to predict binary success with 0.70 AUC based on temporal and funding-related features. Developed an optimal regression tree to predict valuation growth multiples over five years, achieving an R² of 0.46. Applied weighted average robust optimization to allocate funding across startups based on a given budget. On a 20% test set of 1,500 startups, selecting 10 startups per portfolio resulted in an 11.5× return on investment.
